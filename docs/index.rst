About the Field Manual
=================================================

The 1st RRF Field Manual is our central resource of all written information and documentation. It forms the core structure, policies and tactics of the unit both in and out of the game environment. The entire manual is published at `documentation.1st-rrf.com`_ and can be downloaded as both a PDF and Ebook should members wish to read the document in a different setting.

Our training is specific to our game environment however a lot of the content is portable within the wider ARMA community. In the interest of transparency and to try to pay back the wider community we license this manual under CC BY-NC 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which means you can adapt, modify and redistribute this content as long as you do not financially profit from it and that you attribute the source document back to us.

We are always interested in establishing cross training and modpack compatability with other groups in the ARMA community. If you would like to standardize your training around our documentation then we are always happy to help explain the documents as well as establish training programs and an operational relationship with your unit. Simply get in touch with us by joining our teamspeak at ts.1st-rrf.com.
